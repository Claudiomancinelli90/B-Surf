INSTRUCTIONS TO REPRODUCE FIG. 3 OF THE PAPER

-Compile

within the submitted repository, run the following commands in the terminal:

mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ../
make 

This will create a repository "bin" containing the executable.

REMARKS:
1) the "cmake ../" procedures may throw some errors if Eigen is not installed in your computer. Do not mind them, the code will compile just fine.

2) there will be some warnings during the compiling coming from external libraries.

-Run 
within the submitted repository, run the following command in the terminal:

./bin/splinetest data/bunny.obj

This will open a GUI with the bunny mesh with the BÃ©zier curve in Fig.3 already drawn on it.

To use the GUI in its general implementation, please refer to the README file in this repository.
